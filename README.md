# Collection_Exercise_1

1. Program 1:
 Write a Java program to update the specific array element by given element and empty the array list .
Input: [Apple, Grape, Melon, Berry]
Output: [Kiwi, Grape, Mango, Berry]
Array list after removing all elements [ ]

2. Program 2:
Problem Statement: Create ArrayList and Search elements in the List
   
 Define the below static methods in class `FruitsListService`:

 addFruitsToList(String) : List<String>      
 
Should take a String input containing names of fruits separated by comma(see  below), and display a List of the Fruit names
                	"apple,mango,Cherry"
  Should not add duplicate fruits to the list (Same fruit name in upper/lower/mixed should be also considered duplicates)

    
searchFruitInList(List<String>, String) : int

            - Should take a fruit list and fruit name to be searched as parameters
            - Should display the index of the fruit in the list, if it's found
            - Should display “not found”, if the fruit is not found
            - Should do a "case-sensitive" search   
                        
searchFruitInListIgnoreCase(List<String>, String) : int

  - Should take a fruit list and fruit name to be searched as parameters
   - Should display the index of the fruit in the list, if it's found
     - Should display “not found”, if the fruit is not found
    - Should do a "case-insensitive" search   
    
3. Program 3:
Write a program to calculate the sum of elements of two input arraylists.


getSumOfListElements(List<Integer> firstList, List<Integer> secondList
This method displays the List with the sum of elements of two input lists
 		
Rules
 An element in the final displayed list is the sum of elements in input lists at the same index. 
 For example, if L1 and L2 are input lists, and L3 is the final list, then L3.get(n) must be equal to the sum of L1.get(n) and L2.get(n).

 The sizes of both Lists may differ. 
 Assuming that the sizes of both lists are 's1' and 's2', the new list should be of size equals to largest of s1 and s2. 
  If L1 is larger than L2 then the last (s1-s2) elements in the returned list should be same as the corresponding elements in the list L1
If any of the list is null, it should be considered as empty list


4. Program 4:
Write a program to implement a set interface which sorts the given randomly ordered names in ascending order. Convert the sorted set in to an array list

Input : Harry Olive Alice Bluto Eugene
Output :
Sorted Set : Alice Bluto Eugene Harry Olive
Array list from Set : Alice Bluto Eugene Harry Olive




5. Program 5: 
Given a catalog list and search value, sort the list and search for the given value in sorted list
Create a class named CatalogSortedListSearch with the following methods:
+catalogListSearcher(String) : String  
     - Should take a String as input and display a string as result
     - Should display an error message when the String is null or empty or blank space  
     - Should iterate the sorted list to check String existence and display Found or Not Found
+catalogListSorter(List<String>) : String
     - Should validate the List and return error message when it is null or empty and contains value like empty or blank space or null 
     - Should sort the List using Collections                 
     - Should return the global class List variable

Example: Sample Input:
[Nike, Puma, Adidas, Reebok, UnderArmour, NBalance, SuperDry] AND reebok      
Expected Output:
Found: Reebok

Sample Input:
[Nike, Puma, Adidas, Reebok, UnderArmour, NBalance, SuperDry] AND Lee
Expected Output:
"Not Found"

Sample Input:
[Nike, Puma, Adidas, Reebok, UnderArmour, null, SuperDry] AND Lee
Expected Output:
"The catalog List contains empty or null or blank space as a value"

Sample Input:
null    
Expected Output:
"Input is not accepted"

Sample Input:
[ ]    
Expected Output:
"The catalog list is empty"

Sample Input:
[Nike, Puma, Adidas, Reebok, UnderArmour, NBalance, SuperDry]      
Expected Output:
[Adidas, NBalance, Nike, Puma, Reebok, SuperDry, UnderArmour]

6. Program 6
 Create a class Patient
registrationNumber:int
 name: String
gender: char
  Create a class PatientService
	Implement the below methods
	
**Create a set of type Patient**

addPatient(int registrationNumber, String name, char gender)
Add the patient details to set and display the set

searchPatient(int registrationNumber)
   This method searches a patient in the set given

getAllPatientsByGender(char gender)
  This method returns a Set of patients for a given gender in the sorted order of patient name
